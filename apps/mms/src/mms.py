""" This simulation uses the Method of Manufactured Solutions to test solution convergence.

An manufactured/'analytical' solution for phi is substituted into the 2D advection-diffusion equation.
The non-zero residual is then subtracted from the RHS via a source term, such that
the manufactured solution then becomes the actual solution of the modified equation.

For more information about the procedure, see:

Roache (2002). Code Verification by the Method of Manufactured Solutions. Journal of Fluids Engineering, 124(1), 4-10. doi: 10.1115/1.1436090
